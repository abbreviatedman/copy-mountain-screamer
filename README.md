# Copy Mountain Screamer

### Introduction

Today we'll be revisiting a site from days long past. A responsive site that we built (well, copied) with our bare hands--and sure, maybe a `display: flex` or `display: grid` here and there helped us, but we still have the callouses and even scars to show that work, real _work_ was done.

Anyway, we'll be destroying those beautiful monuments we built and putting them back together again, this time with Bootstrap as our layout mortar.

For science!


### What You'll Be Building

You'll be taking the product of one of the inferiorly-named versions of the majestic Mountain Screamer - either [Copy Cougar](https://github.com/abbreviatedman/copy-cougar) or [Copy Puma](https://github.com/abbreviatedman/copy-puma). You'll fork it--using GitHub's new New Repo from Template feature!--, strip out any Flexbox- or Grid-related rules, and give our html some Bootstrap classes to re-implement our various layouts.
