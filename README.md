# Copy Mountain Screamer

### Introduction

Today we'll be revisiting a site from days long past. A responsive site that we built (well, copied) with our bare hands--and sure, maybe a `display: flex` or `display: grid` here and there helped us, but we still have the callouses and even scars to show that work, real _work_ was done.

Anyway, we'll be destroying those beautiful monuments we built and putting them back together again, this time with Bootstrap as our layout mortar.

For science!


### What You'll Be Building

You'll be taking the product of one of the inferiorly-named versions of the majestic Mountain Screamer - either [Copy Cougar](https://github.com/abbreviatedman/copy-cougar) or [Copy Puma](https://github.com/abbreviatedman/copy-puma), whichever you prefer (and whether that preference is for a good match for Bootstrap or a... challenging match). You'll fork it--using GitHub's new New Repo from Template feature!--, strip out any Flexbox- or Grid-related rules, and give our html some Bootstrap classes to re-implement our various layouts.


### Guidelines

* Download Bootstrap, don't link it. Just for practice doing it that way!
* You do NOT have to use any Bootstrap components. In fact, their components are almost definitely not going to fit into the asthetic of your copied site without major modifications.
* You _should_ have all of the content of your page already from a previous assignment, so our main focus is on re-implementing each of our responsive layouts.
* That said, if you still need to finish copying the content of a page, make it happen!
* You need to have the same number of layouts as before, but the breakpoints should be [Bootstrap's breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints).
* Try to solve EVERY layout problem with Bootstrap's grid layout classes. Before you decide it's impossible, get our approval! We may know of a way.
* If everyone agrees it's impossible, you can go ahead and use Flexbox or Grid.


### Stretch Goals

* Redo one element from your page with a Bootstrap component, extending the class to match the page around it.
* Redo more elements as Bootstrap components!
* More coming soon!
